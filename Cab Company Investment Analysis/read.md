# 🚕 Cab Company Investment Analysis – EDA & Business Insight Project

## 📌 Description

This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal was to assist a simulated client (XYZ) in choosing between two competing cab companies for potential investment.

Over **849,000+ records** across **four datasets** were cleaned, merged, and analysed to extract key business insights using Python and data visualization techniques.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Determine which cab company offers better profitability and customer engagement
- Analyze customer behavior, city-wise performance, and operational scale
- Provide data-backed recommendations to guide XYZ’s investment decision

## 🗂️ Datasets Used
- `Cab_Data.csv` – Ride-level transactional data
- `Transaction_ID.csv` – Payment modes and customer-transaction mapping
- `Customer_ID.csv` – Demographic details
- `City.csv` – City-level population and user metrics

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Analytical Highlights
- Merged multi-source data into a unified analysis-ready DataFrame
- Created custom metrics: profit per trip, distance categories, ride retention
- Conducted **7 hypothesis tests** including seasonality, payment preferences, and profitability
- Discovered:
  - Yellow Cab had **156% higher profit per trip**
  - **225% more distance covered** than Pink Cab
  - **70.77% customer retention**, outperforming Pink Cab
- Delivered insights that could **reduce investment risk by 40%** and prioritize **urban markets with up to 3× ROI potential**

## 📈 Outcome
- Final deliverables include a well-documented Jupyter Notebook, Data Intake Report, and business recommendations for strategic investment.
- Simulates a real-world data analytics consulting scenario focused on business impact.
